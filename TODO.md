#TODO list

1. configure lsp to show more expressive text enable clangd for c code, and do more hovers and more vscode like features for it
2. start coding swift app for producitbity, it will ask 4 different things and then remind you throughout the day to do them
3. configure the lsp for rust and point it towards the i686 gcc compiler, also for c and cpp, the last frontier is the lsp
4. finish the rust project for harpoon autoloading, keep working on kernel stuff.
you could also finish the bit project for go if you wanted to we'll see
if you need a refresher look at the chatgpt chats.
also try to get the debugger working for c and for rust. the debug and gdb commands open two different processes.
printing currently does work but not formatting in the rust kernel yet.
possibly make some progress on the go tool that you've been working on.

 you could also possibly make a bind to spawn a second terminal or new terminal for those debug sessions although those windows might not be big enough

in the mean time doing a byte/bit decoder for gdt idt and paging entires, and multiboot map and do a qemu runner. doing rust in action will also help quite a bit, and the rust nomican and the rust book.
there is training for the rust book in rust-learning
